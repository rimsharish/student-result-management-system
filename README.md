## ✅ Before You Start

Make sure you have these installed on your computer:

1. **Python** (version 3.8 or above) → [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **pip** (comes installed with Python)
3. **Git** (to clone the project) → [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

You can check if Python and pip are installed by running:

```

## 🚀 Getting Started (Step-by-Step Setup)

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-result-management-system.git
cd student-result-management-system
```

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (recommended)

A virtual environment keeps this project's packages separate from other Python projects on your system.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3️⃣ Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Apply database migrations

This sets up the database tables Django needs.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5️⃣ Create an admin (superuser) account

This lets you log in to Django's admin panel to manage data.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You'll be asked to enter a username, email, and password.

### 6️⃣ Run the project

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 7️⃣ Open it in your browser

Go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

To access the admin panel:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

## 🧩 How the Project Works (Quick Overview)

- `DJANGO_PROJECT/` contains the **core settings** of the whole project — like database configuration, installed apps, and URL routing.
- `results/` is the Django **app** where the actual logic lives — models (database tables), views (what happens when you visit a page), and templates (the HTML pages you see).
- `manage.py` is the tool you'll use to run commands like starting the server or creating migrations.
